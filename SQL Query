SQL QUERY

QUESTION : ACTIVE USER RETENTION 
Assume you have the table below containing information on Facebook user actions. Write a query to obtain the active user retention in July 2022. Output the month (in numerical format 1, 2, 3) and the number of monthly active users (MAUs).
Hint: An active user is a user who has user action ("sign-in", "like", or "comment") in the current month and last month.
user_actions Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id, 
event_id, 
event_type, 
event_date	

SQL Query One: 
SELECT EXTRACT (MONTH FROM curr_month.event_date) AS mth,
       COUNT (DISTINCT curr_month.user_id) AS monthly_active_user 
FROM user_actions AS curr_month
JOIN user_actions AS last_month
ON curr_month.user_id = last_month.user_id
AND EXTRACT (MONTH from last_month.event_date) = EXTRACT (MONTH from current_month.event_date - interval '1 month')
WHERE EXTRACT (MONTH FROM curr_month.event_date)= 7
AND EXTRACT (YEAR FROM curr_month.event_date)= 2022
GROUP BY EXTRACT (MONTH FROM curr_month.event_date);

The number of user retention is 2 in the month of July.
